This is an ATM web app made by Liraz Bar-Nir.

If you first enter the app, you will need to enter your credit card data - 16 digits of the card number and 4 digits of PIN code (Don't worry, i'm not a real bank. I don't care if you will make some credit card data out of your mind).

After you entered your credit card data (rather if it was just now, or an hour ago, or even one week ago - I saved it on your local storage) you will enter the PIN validation page - there, you will need to register with your PIN code. Again don't worry - the PIN code will be logged to the console. Sakhbak here to help you (unless someone else stole your computer, than - unlucky you). You will have 3 tries to enter your PIN code, unless you will be blocked for ever and ever, or until it will restart one code line after it alert you. If you have serval cards, it will log you out and you will have to choose which card you want to do actions on. You can choose different card at all over the process and even add new cards.

After you successfully logged in, you will have the possibilities to do see your balance, to withdraw money and deposit money (when first entering a credit card, you will automatic receive 1000 shekels - a gift from me to you).every action you will do, will update the local storage so you can go to sleep (or take some Udemy courses) and return to the page in the next day, log in with your PIN code and see the withdraw or deposit actions you made to remain as you left it!
