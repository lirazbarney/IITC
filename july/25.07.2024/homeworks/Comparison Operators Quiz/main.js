//Comparison Operators Quiz
//task 1
console.log(`task 1: the regular equality operator in js is somehow \"===\" while in other normal languages is just \"==\"`);

//task 2
console.log(`task 2: the difference between \"==\" and "===" is that "==" check the equality without checking its type while "===" check both the content and the type`);

//task 3
console.log(`task 3: to check if 2 values are equal you will use === between them in "if" statement (or in any boolean expression)`);

//task 4
console.log(`task 4: the > operator checks if the left value is grater than the right value`);

//task 5
console.log(`task 5: the < operator checks if the left value is less than the right value`);

//task 6
console.log(`task 6: to check if some value is grater or equal to another value you will use the >= operator between them in a boolean expression`);

//task 7
console.log(`task 7: to check if some value is less or equal to another value you will use the <= operator between them in a boolean expression`);

//task 8
console.log(`task 8: the result of 5 > 3 supposed to be true`);
console.log(`task 8: the result of 5 > 3 is actually ${5 > 3}`);

//task 9
console.log(`task 9: js is a weird language and instead of yelling an error, I assume that 10 === "10" will be  fasle`);
console.log(`task 9: the actual result of 10 === "10" is ${10 === "10"}`);

//task 10
console.log(`task 10: the result of 7 <= 7 in js should be true`);
console.log(`task 10: the result of 7 <= 7 in js is actually ${7 <= 7}`);

//task 11
console.log(`task 11: to compare 2 strings alphabetically you will use regular comparing operators like the > or the <. the first it will appear in dictionaries, the lower value it will get`);

//task 12
console.log(`task 12: the result of "apple" < "banana" should be true because "apple" comes before "banana" in an alphabetical order`);
console.log(`task 12: the actual result of "apple" < "banana" is ${"apple" < "banana"}`);

//task 13
console.log(`task 13: the !== operator checks if the 2 values are different (if (val1 === val2) is false)`);

//task 14
console.log(`task 14: i think that in other programming languages, any comparing between a string and a number will get an error but in js i assume that 5 !== "5" will be true`);
console.log(`task 14: the actual result of 5 !== "5" is ${5 !== "5"}`);

//task 15
console.log(`task 15: using the === operator with different data type would consider immediately false but with the == operator it might be considered as true`);
