//Data Types Quiz
//task 1
console.log(`task 1: the data type of x when "x = 5" should be number (why not int like any other languages ):`);
let x = 5;
console.log(`task 1: the actual data type of x when "x = 5" is ${typeof(x)}`);

//task 2
console.log(`task 2: to declare a string variable in js you have to do so: let str = "some string";`);

// task 3
console.log(`task 3: the differences between null and undefined is that undefined is automatically set to a variable if its not got assigned a value and null represent the absent of value or object and is also need to be explicitly assigned`);

// task 4
console.log(`task 4: to check a variable type you will have to use the "typeof" function and to pass inside the () the variable`);

// task 5
console.log(`task 5: the result of typeof(5 / 2) should be number (or float in any other normal programming languages)`);
console.log(`task 5: the data type of 5 / 2 is actually a ${typeof(5 / 2)}`);

// task 6
console.log(`task 6: the data type of true is called boolean`);
console.log(`task 6: the actual data type of true is ${typeof(true)}`);

// task 7
console.log(`task 7: to declare an object in js you will have to do this: let name {var1: val, var2: val ...};`);

// task 8
console.log(`task 8: I assume that the data type of NaN should be NaN`);
console.log(`task 8: the  data type of NaN is actually ${typeof(NaN)}`);

// task 9
console.log(`task 9: the difference between \"==\" and "===" is that "==" check the equality without checking its type while "===" check both the content and the type`);

// task 10
console.log(`task 10: to convert a string to a number you will use the Number function and pass the string in the ()`);
console.log(`task 10: ${typeof(Number("4"))}`);

// task 11
console.log(`task 11: the data type of "5" + 3 supposed to be string (although in other programming languages there is no such thing as string + number/int)`);
console.log(`task 11: the actual data type of "5" + 3 is ${typeof("5" + 3)}`);

// task 12
console.log(`task 12: to check if a variable is from a specific type you will have to compare the typeof(variable) to the specific type you want`);

// task 13
console.log(`task 13: to create a multi-line string in js you will have to use the \' \' marks`);

// task 14
console.log(`task 14: while '' and "" are the same, \`\` allow for more additional features like \$\{\} and multi-line strings`);

// task 15
console.log(`task 15: to convert a number to a string you will have to use the String function and pass the number to it inside the ()`);
console.log(`task 15: ${typeof(String(6))}`);

// task 16
console.log(`task 16: i assume thar the result of typeof(null) should be null`);
console.log(`task 16: the result of typeof(null) is actually ${typeof(null)}`);

// task 17
console.log(`task 17: to declare a constant in js you will use the word "const" instead of "let" and will initialize it with a value`);

// task 18
console.log(`task 18: when adding a string and a number in js (unlike any other normal programming languages), the result will be string and should be handling like any other strings`)

// task 19
console.log(`task 19: the data type of 3 > 2 should be boolean`);
console.log(`task 19: the actual data type of 3 > 2 is ${typeof(3 > 2)}`);

// task 20
console.log(`task 20: to escape spacial characters in string you will need to use the backslash before it - \\ or put the whole string in backticks - \``);

// task 21
console.log(`task 21: while "const" will not allow you to change its value, "let" and "var" will allow you to do so. the difference between them is mostly about scoping.`);

// task 22
console.log(`task 22: to check if a variable is undefined you will need to compare the variable or its data type to undefined`);

// task 23
console.log(`task 23: in any other programming languages, doing 10 + "5" will cause an error but in js the result should be 105`);
console.log(`task 23: the result of 10 + "5" is actually ${10 + "5"}`);

// task 24
console.log(`task 24: to create a boolean variable you will need to first assign it with either true or false values`);

// task 25
console.log(`task 25: the primitive data types is regular data types while objects are built from different primitive data type and are transferred as a reference`);

console.log(`פיטוסי אם אתה רואה את זה אז תדע שג׳אווה סקריפט היא השפה השטנית  וג׳אווה היא השפה הכי טובה שיש :)`);
